        "objective": "To investigate and compare the trajectories and time of descent of a ball and a feather dropped from the same height in a controlled environment.",
        "equipment_setup": "The following equipment is required for this experiment: 1. A building with a flat, open-top floor or a large, open-air balcony. 2. A measuring tape to determine the height. 3. Two identical objects: a ball and a feather. 4. A stopwatch or timer. 5. A sheet or mat to catch the objects upon landing. 6. Optional: A camera to record the descent for further analysis.",
        "procedure": "1. Measure the height of the building's top floor or balcony with the measuring tape. 2. Ensure the area is clear and safe for the objects to be dropped. 3. Place the ball and feather on the edge of the building's top floor or balcony. 4. Start the stopwatch or timer as you release the ball and feather simultaneously, ensuring they are dropped from the same height. 5. Record the time it takes for each object to hit the sheet or mat using the stopwatch or timer. 6. Optionally, take photographs or videos of the descent for further analysis.",
        "observations": "During the experiment, observe and record the following: 1. The time it takes for the ball and feather to hit the sheet or mat. 2. The trajectories of the ball and feather during their descent. 3. Any noticeable differences in wind resistance between the ball and feather.",
        "results": "Anticipated results: The ball and feather will start their descent at the same time and speed due to being dropped from the same height. However, due to differences in their densities and shapes, the feather, being lighter and more aerodynamic, is expected to reach the ground sooner than the ball. The ball's descent may be influenced by air resistance more than the feather's, causing it to take longer to reach the ground. The trajectories of the ball and feather will also likely differ, with the ball following a more curved path due to greater air resistance."
